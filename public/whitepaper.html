                <h2 class="headline">Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZK Protocol)</h2>
                <p class="description">A zero-knowledge proof, sometimes also referred to as a ZK protocol, is a verification method that takes place between a prover and a verifier. In a zero-knowledge proof system, the prover is able to prove to the verifier that they have the knowledge of a particular piece of information (such as the solution to a mathematical equation) without revealing the information itself. These proof systems can be used to provide increased levels of privacy and security.</p>
                <p class="description">The concept of a zero-knowledge proof was first described in a 1985 MIT paper, published by Shafi Goldwasser and Silvio Micali. They demonstrated that it was possible to prove some properties of a number without disclosing the number or any additional information about it. This paper also introduced the mathematically significant finding that interactions between a prover and a verifier could reduce the amount of information required to prove a given theorem.</p>
                <p class="description">A ZK proof must fulfill two basic requirements known as completeness and soundness. Completeness refers to the ability of the prover to demonstrate knowledge of the relevant information to a high degree of probable accuracy. For the proof to be sound, the verifier must be able to reliably determine whether or not the prover is actually in possession of the information. Finally, in order to be truly zero-knowledge, the proof must achieve both completeness and soundness without the information in question ever being communicated between the prover and the verifier.</p>

                <h2 class="headline">Safe ZK Products: Safe Protocol and Safe Trader AI</h2>
                <div class="box" id="content3-1">
                    <h2 class="headline">Safe Protocol</h2>
                    <p class="description">Safe Protocol is a decentralized privacy-focused protocol built on the BSC blockchain (as specified in the Roadmap, the ETH version of Safe Protocol will be deployed soon). The main goal is to provide users with a way to make anonymous transactions on the BSC network, shielding their identity and making it harder to trace transactions.</p>
                    <p class="description">The Protocol uses a cryptographic technique called Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) to ensure the privacy of its users. With ZKPs, users can prove the validity of a transaction without revealing any information about the transaction itself.</p>
                    <p class="description">The first question that may arise is why the Safe ZK developers considered the BSC Blockchain as the first provider of cryptocurrency mixing.</p>
                    <p class="description">Safe ZK brings more safety due to its non-dependence on third parties such as Infura. Being on the BSC Blockchain gives it an unprecedented advantage. This is due to the fact that one of the main disruptors of similar cryptocurrency mixing protocols (like Tornado) was the fact that they were entirely reliant on data from Infura as being a principal source for validating transactions on ETH. This third party is not an open API such as the one from Bscscan, which cannot be preferentially interrupted, but a private company that was able to completely disrupt the operations and functionality of Tornado. Therefore, an inherent advantage of our creation of a crossover into BSC means infinitely more security and reliability for your transactions, without the possibility of it ever being interrupted or suspended.</p>
                    <p class="description">Safe Protocol uses a system of smart contracts to enable users to deposit BNB into a privacy pool. Once the tokens are in the pool, users can make anonymous transactions by withdrawing tokens from the pool to a new address, effectively breaking the link between their identity and the transactions. Cryptocurrency mixing is obfuscating the transaction trail on the blockchain. By mixing transactions with other users, the transaction history is blurred, making it impossible to track the origin and destination of the transaction.</p>
                    <p class="description">All operations are conducted on a decentralized architecture, removing the need for central authorities or intermediaries, empowering users to retain control of their assets and transactions.</p>

                    <h2 class="headline">SafeAI Trader</h2>
                    <p class="description">SafeAI Trader is an automated trading Artificial Intelligence software that is currently trained in learning how the crypto market news, real-world news, economic data, and social media coverage are related to the trading volume, thereby anticipating the price of specific crypto assets. SafeAI is set to combine all this data with mathematical extrapolation to identify and predict the price for the next time frame.</p>
                    <p class="description">As a result, SafeAI Trader will be trained to predict the price action of the first 100 crypto coins for a specific time frame. It will predict any possible market squeeze, flash crashes, or super spikes while checking CEX accumulations vs real wallet accumulations.</p>
                    <p class="description"><u><b>Crypto Assets Trades</b></u></p>
                    <p class="description">SafeAI Trader will be able to make automated trading for a user/investor, in order to receive a minimum 10% monthly profit from multiple safe trades.</p>
                    <p class="description">The user will also have the possibility to set SafeAI Trader to make only small investments with a high-income rate, specifying exactly the amount expected in return (for example, a 20x investment). In this case, during a week, the trading AI may not trigger any trades, waiting for the right moment when the parameters will indicate a minimum 70% chance for a high return on the set investment.</p>
                    <p class="description"><u><b>Futures Trading</b></u></p>
                    <p class="description">As explained, the Safe AI trading algorithm will learn billions of historical data points, adding millions of present data points like news, social media data, NASDAQ trading volumes and indices, stock market indices, oil prices, and economic data from all over the world.</p>
                    <p class="description">Based on this and the historical volume and price of a certain coin, it will be able to make precise price assumptions for each of the first 100 crypto assets.</p>
                    <p class="description">Safe AI trading will be the first AI capable of making time frame predictions for a certain time frame, like for example 15 or 30 minutes, but also for one month or one year time frame.</p>

                <h2 class="headline">Safe ZK Token</h2>
                <p class="description">Safe ZK Token (SAFEZK) serves as the native utility token within the Safe ZK ecosystem, used for various functions, including governance, fee reductions, accessing platform services, and staking.</p>
                <p class="description">The token distribution is designed to ensure fair allocation and long-term sustainability, with allocations for community incentives, development, marketing, and team compensation.</p>
                <p class="description">Investors who own over $1,000 worth of SAFEZK will have only a 1% transaction fee when they use Safe Protocol.</p>
                <p class="description">Also, in order to open trading positions using SafeAI Trader, you will have to own SAFEZK. The USD value of the trading positions will be correlated with the amount of owned SAFEZK.</p>
                <p class="description"><b>For example:</b></p>
                <ul>
                    <li class="description"><p>SILVER TIER - if you own a value of $1,000 in SAFEZK, you will be able to open trading positions of $10,000 each month</p></li>
                    <li class="description"><p>GOLDEN TIER - if you own a value between $1,000 and $5,000 in SAFEZK, you will be able to open trading positions of $50,000 each month</p></li>
